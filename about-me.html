				<p>I have external video cameras which allows me to review driving situations during driving lessons, by playing back footage on my iPad. I give a personalised Progress Record booklet, which I update after every lesson and also have the knowledge of how the examiner says things, and how they mark the test report sheet, due to sitting in on most of my pupils tests. My car is always clean, tidy and well maintained: it is a Seat Ibiza FR, in a vibrant bright Green, and includes all the extras!</p>
				<p>I also have a Theory Test Pro account, which all my learners can use to help you pass!</p>
