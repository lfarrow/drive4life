				<h2>Learning to Drive</h2>
				<p>You can apply for your provisional driving licence 3 months before your 17th birthday, this will then enable you to have your first ever driving lesson on your birthday! Apply for your licence at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-first-provisional-driving-licence" target="_blank">www.direct.gov.uk</a> and allow between 10 days and 4 weeks for processing. Alternatively you can complete the application form D1 that is available from either the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) form ordering service. or from your local Post Office.</p>

				<p>The National average Driver Training hours before being 'up to standard' is 45-50 hours by a Professional Driving Instructor, with additional private tuition being encouraged too. You can speed up your process of learning by employing a highly trained Qualified Driving Instructor as opposed to a Trainee Driving Instructor. It is a legal requirement that The Instructor displays a badge in the front windscreen. If the Instructor displays a green hexagonal badge this proves that they have passed the exam with the DVSA testing their ability to teach you. Those displaying a pink triangular badge is a Trainee Instructor meaning they have little or no experience and have no formal qualifications to teach pupils.</p>				 

				<p>I am a fully qualified ADI (Approved Driving Instructor), with a higher than average pass rate. Currently the national pass rate is 43%, my first time pass rate is above 78%</p>

				<h2>About your theory and practical test</h2>
				<p>The Theory Test is made up of two parts; a multiple choice section and hazard perception test. When you take your test, you will have to pass both parts successfully to complete your Theory test. passing one section alone will mean you have to re-sit the whole test. Once have passed your Theory you have then got up to 24 months to complete your Practical Driving Test.</p>

				<p>When attending your Theory Test it is very important you take along with you both parts of your Driving Licence including the paper Counterpart, (otherwise your test will not take place and you will lose your fee)! If you hold an old-style paper licence then you must take your signed Licence and a separate photo identification with you, such as your passport.
				Also required is your booking confirmation letter.</p>

				<p>For Taking the Practical Driving Test, you must take with you your confirmation letter, your Theory Test Certificate and both parts of your licence (as previously mentioned).
				The Practical Driving Test last for up to 40 minutes, and now includes 10-15 minutes of Independent Driving. This is when the Examiner tells you to follow road signs or a diagram, without further verbal instruction. This sounds daunting, however it really is straight forward, and I will give you the opportunity of Mock Tests.</p>
